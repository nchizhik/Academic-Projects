The ShopCare app is created in the LabWindows environment, in C.

The main file which describes the process of the program is the 'ShopCare.c' file.

For the '.exe' file to function well, you will need to connect manualy or virtualy the serial port of your COM. I used Virtual Serial Port Tools app for my computer. Very ease to use. Its is just a demo :) Enjoy
